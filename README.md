Online Course Registration System:Every semester of college we undergo the tedious process of course registration which involves a lot of papers,time and also requires physical presence.What this project aims at is to simplify the process of registration. 

This project involves setting up of a website which has access to the database of college .The users are prompted to log into their accounts using  id and password.After logging into their accounts, users are presented with courses avialable to them depending on their branch and year.Users are then asked to select the courses they are interested in.After the selection process the sum of credits of all courses is compared with the minimum credits.If the number of credits are greater than the minimum credits then college database is updated and the end result of the update of database is shown to the user.
